We ask that you only spend up to an hour on the task.

Javascript is favourable as it's within our stack, but you're free to use what you're comfortable with.

## Description

No more hiding from your alarm clock! You’ve decided you want your computer to keep you updated on the time so you’re never late again. A talking clock takes a 24-hour time and translates it into words.

## Input Description

An hour (0-23) followed by a colon followed by the minute (0-59).

## Output Description

The time in words, using 12-hour format followed by am or pm.

00:00

20:29
21:00
```

## Sample Output Data

```
It's twelve am
It's one thirty am
It's twelve oh five pm
It's two oh one pm
It's eight twenty nine pm
It's nine pm
```

## Things To Remember

This test is designed to assess your problem-solving ability and there are no “right” or “wrong” answers here (but there are correct and incorrect outputs!). We are interested in what assumptions you make, or don’t make, and how you consider the problem to come to your ultimate solution.

Good luck!
